* In linear regression any linear transformation of the input variables results in changes to the coefficients the residuals and all the metrics used to diagnose the quality of the model estimate.

* Using a simple dataset I attempt to demonstrate the effect of such transformations by displaying a side by side cofficient table and plotting accompanying plots of the residuals.

* The user can control what transformation is added to the input variables as well as adding and removing any variables.

* Known glitches are still being ironed out of the code.
